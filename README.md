Tabs Outliner for Firefox Addon
===============================

This addon aims to implement for firefox the feature provided by
the [TabsOutliner plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-outliner/eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl) in Chromium.

Here is a screenshot of what it looks like at the time of the first
revision in this repository:

For the time being it is only a work in progress. That plugin is
aimed to be compatible with Firefox 18+, and uses the jetpack/addon
API. 

TODO
----
    - refresh the tree on every window and tabs events (new, close, ready, refresh, 
        tab movement...),
    - create new level of tree when opening tabs from a tab,
    - open/close, destroy support from the tabs outliner panel,
    - drag and drop support for the tabs in the tree,
    - better UI style,
    - sidebar integration

If you want a taboutliner for firefox, don't hesitate to help me 
implement that plugin and send patches!

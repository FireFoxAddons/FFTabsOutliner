Tabs Outliner for Firefox Addon
===============================

This addon aims to implement for firefox the feature provided by
the [TabsOutliner plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-outliner/eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl) in Chromium.

For the time being it is only a work in progress. That plugin is
aimed to be compatible with Firefox 18+, and uses the jetpack/addon
API. 

If you want a taboutliner for firefox, don't hesitate to help me 
implement that plugin and send patches!

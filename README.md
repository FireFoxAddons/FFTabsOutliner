The Tabs Outliner Addon for Firefox
===================================

This addon aims to implement for Firefox the feature provided by
the [TabsOutliner plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-outliner/eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl) in Chromium, but
in an Opensource License.


Here is a screenshot of what it looks like at the time of the last 
major change in this repository:

For the time being it is only a work in progress. That plugin is
aimed to be compatible with Firefox 18+, and uses the jetpack/addon
API. 

TODO
----
 * `[x]` refresh the tree on every window and tabs events (new, close, ready, refresh, 
     tab movement...), _(in v0.4)_ 
 * `[#]` _select_, open/_close_, destroy support from the tabs outliner panel, _(will be v0.5)_
 * `[ ]` drag and drop support for the tabs in the tree, _(should be v0.6)_
 * `[ ]` create new level of tree when opening tabs from a tab and support groups of windows, _(should be v0.7)_
 * `[ ]` session state saving support, _(might be v0.8)_
 * `[ ]` sidebar integration, _(may be v0.9)_
 * `[ ]` better UI style, _(may be v0.10)_
 * `[ ]` no bugs, no glitches _(v1.0)_

If you want a taboutliner for firefox, don't hesitate to help me 
implement that plugin and send patches!

How it works
============

As of version v0.4, the algorithm of the addon is far from being good.
At each event, it (re)builds a two level tree of all opened windows and tabs,
and (re)generates the DOM tree in the tabsoutliner tab.
Though, it is not time and space efficient, the result is still (astonishly) fast.

For v0.7, the algorithmic model might have to be rewritten to support a n-level
tree representing the tabs opened while browsing, and also the creation of groups
of windows.

How to test it and hack
=======================

Download the SDK over [the addons page at Mozilla's](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/builder).
Follow the instructions over there, i.e.:

```
    % wget https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/jetpack/jetpack-sdk-latest.zip
    % unzip jetpack-sdk-latest.zip
    % cd addon-sdk-1.13.1
    % source bin/activate
    % git clone https://github.com/guyzmo/FFTabsOutliner.git
    % cd FFTabsOutliner
    % cfx run
```
